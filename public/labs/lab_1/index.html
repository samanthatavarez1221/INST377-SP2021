Professor Alex's Internet Page

First, the basics.

Alex Heading 1

Headings set your default page size

Add your four mochi images from your tutorial here. 

Lists

Let's make an unordered list.

Add an unordered list element
nest each item inside the unordered list in a list tag
List elements can be in any order

And now, one in order.

Add an ordered list element.
Add your top five music albums in order to the list.
Check it out, numbers by default.

Inline elements

Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.

Add a hard line under here.

This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.

  <h2>Lists</h2>

<p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Javascript is popular</li>
  <li>HTML/CSS </li>
  <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>
<p>An ordered list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Album #1- Wonder</li>
  <li>Album #2- Pilot</li>
  <li>Album #3- Ventura</li>
  <li>Album #4- Astrid</li>
  <li>Album #5- As I Am</li>
</ol>
<h2>Inline Elements</h2>

<p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
phrase.</p>
<p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
of a word or phrase.</p>
<p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to have both!</strong></em></p>
<h2>Empty Elements</h2>
